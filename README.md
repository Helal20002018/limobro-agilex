LiMobro ‚Äì Autonomous Mobile Robot (AgileX)
 
 üìå Project Overview

LiMobro is an AgileX autonomous mobile robot (AMR) platform.
In this project, I developed and optimized multiple modules to improve navigation accuracy, mapping performance, and task automation.

üîß My Contributions

Optimized navigation & mapping: Enhanced SLAM and path planning configurations to achieve higher accuracy and reliability.

Integrated lifting system with QR detection: Developed a vision-based module where the onboard camera detects QR codes on the lifting device. Once detected, the system sends a signal to activate the lifter. The design supports any QR placed on the lifting device, making the solution flexible and scalable.

Yellow line detection & tracking: Implemented computer-vision algorithms to detect and follow a predefined yellow line, enabling reliable path guidance in structured environments.

System testing & validation: Conducted real-world experiments to ensure robustness and accuracy under various operating conditions.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
