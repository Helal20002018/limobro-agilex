LiMobro – Autonomous Mobile Robot (AgileX)
📌 Project Overview

LiMobro is an AgileX autonomous mobile robot (AMR) platform.
In this project, I developed and optimized multiple modules to improve navigation accuracy, mapping performance, and task automation.

🔧 My Contributions

Optimized navigation & mapping files to achieve higher accuracy in SLAM and path planning.

Integrated lifting system: The vehicle automatically lifts when a QR code is detected on the body at the lifting station.

Yellow line detection & tracking: Implemented vision-based line detection to guide the vehicle along a predefined path.

System testing & validation with real-world experiments to ensure robustness.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

ROS / ROS 2 (Navigation, SLAM)

Gazebo (simulation & testing)

OpenCV (line detection)
